Market context:
- Average Daily Volume (ADV): {adv:,} shares
- Recent volatility: {volatility}

Common strategies:
- VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price): Best for large orders (>10% ADV). Executes throughout the day to match volume-weighted average price, minimizing market impact.
- TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price): Good for smaller/medium orders. Distributes order evenly over a time period.
- POV (Percentage of Volume): Executes as a percentage of market volume, follows market flow naturally.
- MOC (Market on Close): Executes at closing auction. Best for closing positions or benchmark tracking.

Selection guidelines:
1. Order size relative to ADV:
   - <1% ADV: TWAP or MOC (low impact)
   - 1-5% ADV: TWAP or POV (moderate)
   - 5-10% ADV: VWAP or POV (careful)
   - >10% ADV: VWAP (essential)

2. Trader's historical preferences:
   - If trader consistently uses a strategy for this symbol → prefer it
   - If trader has strong side preference (BUY vs SELL) → note it

3. Time in Force:
   - DAY orders: Can use any strategy
   - GTC/GTD: Prefer VWAP or TWAP for consistency

4. Volatility:
   - HIGH volatility: VWAP (protects against adverse moves)
   - LOW volatility: TWAP or MOC (simpler, cheaper)
