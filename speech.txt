What you should say (talk track)

“Today, placing an order still means filling out rigid fields.
Traders think in intent — not fields.”

“Our goal is to build an AI-powered trading GUI where the user can simply say:
Buy 100k AAPL with minimal impact.”

“The GUI converts that intent into a fully structured order — instrument, side, quantity, urgency, constraints — and explains what it understood.”

“Nothing is auto-executed blindly.
The user always sees, understands, and controls the outcome.”

Key message to land:
👉 This is an intent-capture and decision-support system — not auto-trading.


What you should say

“Once intent is understood, the next step is strategy — not execution.”

“In phase one, we intentionally limit scope to VWAP, TWAP, and POV.
These are well-understood, benchmarkable, and safe for learning.”

“The AI doesn’t just suggest a strategy — it explains why:
liquidity, order size, urgency, and the user’s past behavior.”

“If the user modifies or overrides the suggestion, that decision is not treated as an error — it’s treated as a learning signal.”

“This is how we personalize without losing control.”

Key message to land:
👉 We optimize for alignment with trader expectations, not blind optimization.

What you should say

“This is the most important slide — and also the most misunderstood topic: learning.”

“There is no real-time learning in production.
Nothing adapts while an order is being executed.”

“All learning happens offline, typically end-of-day.”

“Agent captures explicit user corrections — accepts, overrides, parameter changes.”

“APO reinforcement learning is used to improve prompts, reasoning, and strategy mapping — not to change execution behavior directly.”

“Every change goes through human review, approval, and rollback.”

“This ensures we improve safely, audibly, and incrementally.”

Key message to land:
👉 Inference is real-time. Learning is offline. Humans stay in control.
